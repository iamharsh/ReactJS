React JS Modules

=>ReactJS is an open source JavaScript library designed by Facebook for creating rich and engaging web apps fast and efficiently with minimal coding.

=>Key Reasons to choose React JS:
  ->Simple and easy to learn.
  ->Code reusability and data binding.
  ->Performance and testing.
  ->React components are JavaScript functions.
  ->React JS is flexible and provides hooks that allow you to interface with other libraries and framework.


=>History:
  ->While other technologies such as Angular were available when Facebook developed ReactJS, most developers were forced to do a lot of coding.
  ->What they wanted was a framework that could allow them to break down complex components and reuse the codes to complete their projects faster.
  

=>Solution:
  ->ReactJS provided the solution that developers were looking for.
  ->It uses JSX (a unique syntax that allows HTML quotes as well as HTML tag syntax application for rendering specific subcomponents).
  ->This is very helpful in promoting construction of machine-readable codes and at the same time compounding components into a single-time verifiable file.
  

=>Why many people prefer to use ReactJS?
  ->It brings HTML directly into your JS. Thanks to JSX.
  ->The idea of components is what makes ReactJS unique.
  ->Props in ReactJS make it possible to pass the custom data to a specific UI component.
  ->The State makes it possible to store all the changes in one section.
  ->It uses Virtual DOM that makes the app fast.
  ->A ReactJS developer will help you to craft achievable goals and demonstrate how the business can use the technology to accelerate growth, raising conversions, cutting on costs, and raising conversion rates.
